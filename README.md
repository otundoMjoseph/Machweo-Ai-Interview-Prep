Machweo AI Interview Preparation Platform
This repository contains the full-stack architecture for Machweo, an AI-driven interview preparation application. The system is engineered on a Monorepo structure, which allows for the consolidated management of decoupled frontend and backend services, facilitating streamlined development, maintenance, and multi-platform deployment.

1. Core Architecture and Technology Stack
The platform is built on a modern, MERN-aligned technology stack, chosen for its modularity, efficiency, and scalability.

Component	Technology	Role and Key Functionality
Frontend	React, Vite, Tailwind CSS	Delivers a responsive, single-page application (SPA). Manages client-side state, routing, and asynchronous API communication.
Backend	Node.js, Express.js	Provides the core RESTful API layer, manages business logic, enforces authentication, and handles database interactions.
Persistence	MongoDB, Mongoose	NoSQL database utilized for flexible storage of user profiles and historical interview attempt data.
Intelligence	Google Gemini (via dedicated service)	Serves as the computational engine for generating questions and providing data-driven, contextual feedback.
2. Deployment and Environment Configuration
Machweo utilizes a decoupled deployment strategy, managed from the single repository:

Frontend Deployment: Hosted on Vercel (configured to build from frontend/).
Backend Deployment: Hosted as a Web Service on Render (configured to run from backend/).
Critical Environment Variables
Backend configuration is managed via environment variables that must be set within the Render Dashboard for the production environment.

Variable	Description	Usage Context
PORT	The port the Express server listens on.	Server startup configuration.
MONGO_URI	Secure connection string for the MongoDB Atlas cluster.	Database connection initialization.
JWT_SECRET	Secret key used to sign and verify JSON Web Tokens.	Authentication middleware and session management.
AI_API_KEY	Credential for accessing the Gemini/OpenAI API.	Used by the AI service layer.
3. Local Development Guide
To initiate local development, developers must concurrently run the frontend client and the backend API, maintaining two separate processes.

3.1 Prerequisites
Ensure the following dependencies are available and configured:

Node.js: The version specified in frontend/.nvmrc is the recommended target.
MongoDB: A locally running instance or a valid remote (Atlas) URI.
API Key: Necessary credentials for the integrated AI service.
3.2 Backend Server Setup (backend/)
Environment File: Create a local .env file within the backend/ directory and populate it with development-specific credentials.

Installation and Start:

cd backend
npm install
npm run dev  # Utilizes nodemon for automatic restarts during development
The API will listen on the port defined by the PORT variable (default http://localhost:5000).

3.3 Frontend Client Setup (frontend/)
Installation and Start:
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
The Vite development server typically runs on http://localhost:5173.
4. Architectural Endpoints Reference
Key feature implementation details are located in the following directories, demonstrating the separation of concerns:

Feature Domain	Backend Route File	Backend Controller Logic	Database Schema
Authentication	authRoutes.js	authController.js	User.js
Interview Flow	interviewRoutes.js	interviewController.js	Attempt.js
Frontend Service	Functionality
authService.js	Encapsulates user session management and authentication API calls.
geminiService.js	Abstracts the logic and payload construction for communication with the AI service API.
5. Contributing and Maintenance
We encourage contributions that enhance the platform's functionality, security, or performance.
